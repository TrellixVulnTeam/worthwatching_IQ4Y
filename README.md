This is a personal project of mine to predict whether future football games from the Premier League will be exciting to watch.

# Usage

The data used for this project were sourced from [here](http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php). If you would like to run the notebooks you will need to download the csv files from 2000-01 onwards into a folder in the same directory called 'epl-csvs'.

# Notes
